## **Website Breakdown:**
This website consists of 7 pages total, including:

 - A landing page containing an explanation of the project and links to each visualizations page. 
   Each page has a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image will take the user to that visualization.
   
 - Four visualization pages, each with a descriptive title and heading tag; 
   plot/visualizations for the selected comparison; and a paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  
 - A "Comparisons" page that contains all of the visualizations on the same page so they can be easily and visually compared. 
   Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
	
	
 - A "Data" page that displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations, as a Bootstrap component.
 
 This was website was made using html to display the data, CSS to format the data, and a bit of JavaScript ("Plots" dropdown and popups).
